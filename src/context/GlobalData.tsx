Task 1: Yelp Open Dataset ETL pipeline
Starting by downloading the dataset, I leveraged an EC2-hosted Kafka setup to load JSON messages into S3. Through Lambda's event triggers, I performed quick data transformations. Finally, using Glue Crawler with event triggers, I seamlessly loaded the data into a database that's queryable through Redshift and Athena.

Task 2: Simulate real-time user_login data by Streamlit App 
In my second endeavor, I set up a Streamlit app on EC2, complete with a simple user login interface allowing input of ID and password. Once submitted, data flows through Kafka to S3, and via Glue Crawler to Data Catalog.

Thank Darshil Parmar for his end-to-end data pipeline tutorial on his youtube channel. Those projects are amazing and helps me a lot.
